# RedditFetcher

The program is used to extract data from individual Reddit subreddits.  
Example subreddit link: https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/   
The program collects data about headlines and links to posts and then writes these data to .txt files.  
Sample subreddits names are stored in Slice at the beginning of the main function.
